	 * This method formats the current date into a String. The input is
	 * a long representing the number of milliseconds since Jan. 1, 1970.
	 * The output is a String in the form yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss.ddd GMT.
	 *
	 * The purpose of this class is to format date strings without paying
	 * the price of instantiating ResourceBundles and Locales, which the
	 * java.util.Date class does whenever you format a date string.
	 * As a result, the output of this class is not localized, it does
	 * not take the local time zone into account, and it is possible that
	 * it will not be as accurate as the standard Date class. It is OK
	 * to use this method when, for example, formatting timestamps to
	 * write to db2j.LOG, but not for manipulating dates in language
	 * processing.
	 *
	 * @param time	The current time in milliseconds since Jan. 1, 1970
	 *
	 * @return The date formatted as yyyy/mm/dd hh:mm:ss.ddd GMT.
