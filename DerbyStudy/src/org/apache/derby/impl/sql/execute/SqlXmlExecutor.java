/**
 * This class is really just an execution time "utility" that
 * makes calls to methods on the XMLDataValue interface.  Instances
 * of this class are generated at execution time by the various
 * Derby XML operators--one instance for each row in the target
 * result set--and then the appropriate operator call is made on
 * that instance (see, for example, the generateExpression() methods
 * in UnaryOperatorNode and BinaryOperatorNode).  When an instance
 * of this class is instantiated, one of the arguments that can be
 * provided is an id that is used to retrieve an already-constructed
 * (from compilation time) instance of SqlXmlUtil from the current
 * Activation.  When it comes time to execute the operator, this class
 * just makes the appropriate call on the received XMLDataValue object
 * and passes in the SqlXmlUtil, from which the XMLDataValue can
 * retrieve compile-time objects.  The XMLDataValue can also make
 * calls to various XML-specific utilities on the SqlXmlUtil
 * object.
 *
 * Let's take an example.  Assume the statement that the user
 * wants to execute is:
 *
 *   select id from xtable
 *      where XMLEXISTS('/simple' PASSING BY REF xcol)
 *
 * At compilation time we will compile the expression "/simple"
 * and store the compiled version of the query into an instance
 * of SqlXmlUtil.  Then we will save that instance of SqlXmlUtil
 * as an object in the statement activation, from which we will
 * receive an id that can be used later to retrieve the object
 * (i.e. to retrieve the SqlXmlUtil).  Then, for *each* row
 * in xtable, we'll generate the following:
 *
 *  boolean result =
 *    (new SqlXmlExecutor(activation, compileTimeObjectId)).
 *      XMLExists("/simple", xcol);
 *
 * In other words, for each row we create a new instance of
 * this class and call "XMLExists" on that instance.  Then,
 * as seen below, we retrieve the SqlXmlUtil from the activation
 * and pass that into a call to "XMLExists" on the XML value
 * itself (i.e. xcol).  XMLDataValue.XMLExists() then uses the
 * methods and objects (which include the compiled query
 * expression for "/simple") defined on SqlXmlUtil to complete
 * the operation.
 * 
 * Okay, so why do we use this execution-time SqlXmlExecutor class
 * instead of just generating a call to XMLDataValue.XMLExists()
 * directly?  The reason is that we only want to compile the XML
 * query expression once per statement--and where possible we'd
 * also like to only generate re-usable XML-specific objects
 * once per statement, as well.  If instead we generated a call to
 * XMLDataValue.XMLExists() directly for each row, then we would
 * have to either pass in the expression string and have XMLDataValue
 * compile it, or we would have to compile the expression string
 * and then pass the compiled object into XMLDataValue--in either
 * case, we'd end up compiling the XML query expression (and creating
 * the corresponding XML-specific objects) once for each row in
 * the target result set.  By using the "saveObject" functionality
 * in Activation along with this SqlXmlExecutor class, we make
 * it so that we only have to compile the XML query expression and
 * create XML-specific objects once (at compile time), and then
 * we can re-use those objects for every row in the target
 * result set.  Yes, we're still creating an instance of this
 * class (SqlXmlExecutor) once per row, and yes we have to fetch
 * the appropriate SqlXmlUtil object once per row, but this is
 * still going to be cheaper than having to re-compile the query
 * expression and re-create XML objects for every row.
 * 
 * So in short, this class allows us to improve the execution-time
 * performance of XML operators by allowing us to create XML-
 * specific objects and compile XML query expressions once per
 * statement, instead of once per row.
 *
 * One final note: the reason this class is in this package
 * instead of the types package is that, in order to retrieve
 * the compile-time objects, we have to use the "getSavedObject()"
 * method on the Activation.  But the Activation class is part
 * of the SQL layer (org.apache.derby.iapi.sql.Activation) and
 * we want to keep the types layer independent of the SQL layer
 * because the types can be used during recovery before the SQL
 * system has booted.  So the next logical choices were the compile
 * package (impl.sql.compile) or the execution package; of those,
 * the execution package seems more appropriate since this
 * class is only instantiated and used during execution, not
 * during compilation.
