/**
 * This class provides a disk based implementation of the StIRandomAccess File interface. It is used by the
 * database engine to access persistent data and transaction logs under the directory (default) subsubprotocol.
 *
 * This class extends DirRandomAccessFile to use the java.nio.channels.FileChannel.force() method to
 * implement sync(). Java.nio.channels.FileChannel was introduced in Java 1.4; it was not available in Java 1.3.

     * Construct a StorageRandomAccessFileImpl.
     *
     * @param name The file name.

     *             be synchronized, consistent with the java.io.RandomAccessFile class. However the
     *             StorageRandomAccessFile.sync() method will be called even if the file was opened
     *             in "rws" or "rwd" mode.  If the "rws" or "rwd" modes are supported then the implementation
     *             of StorageRandomAccessFile.sync need not do anything.
     *
     * @exception IllegalArgumentException if the mode argument is not equal to one of "r", "rw".
     * @exception FileNotFoundException if the file exists but is a directory rather than a regular
